I am excited to share a game I developed in just two days, highlighting meticulous attention to detail in collider object integration, visually appealing drawings, immersive sound effects, and essential text and functionalities.

The game boasts seamless interaction through precise collider object implementation, complemented by visually captivating drawings and high-quality sound effects. Basic text and functionalities provide essential guidance, ensuring a smooth gameplay experience.

I am eager to contribute my expertise to the Google Development Student Club in my college and would welcome the opportunity to discuss my qualifications further.

Thank you for considering my application.
